Here  we focus on one of the cores of phrase-based SMT systems, namely the phrase extraction phase. 

A generic and algorithmic approach to phrase extraction (tailored for efficiency) as well as an efficient method for 
evaluating the quality (coverage) of the resulting phrase tables is provided.
